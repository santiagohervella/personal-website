The app provides menu bar separators to group menu bar items for a more streamlined appearance.

It is particularly beneficial on larger screens where menu bar space is ample, as opposed to smaller laptop screens with limited space.

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

[Send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Spaced&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender/Ice if you have it installed.

#### Can the app let me hide and show menu bar items?

That is out of scope for this app. You want something like [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com) or [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/no/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12).

#### Can the app support changing the distance between menu bar items?

You can do that with my [Menu Bar Spacing](/menu-bar-spacing) app.

#### Can the app also support grouping icons in the Dock?

You can do that with my [Supercharge](/supercharge) app.

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I don't plan to localize the app.
