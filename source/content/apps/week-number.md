### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Week%20Number&referrer=Website-FAQ).

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender/Ice if you have it installed.

#### Why does it not show week 53?

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar). You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### Why does it show the last days of December as week 1?

That is called [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

#### It shows the incorrect week number {#incorrect-week-number}

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar), or the inverse. You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### How can I change the week number to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) format?
