Quickly access a monthly calendar from your menu bar.

The app is intentionally simple. Check out [Dato](/dato) for more features and settings.

The calendar displays dates and days in your language, but the rest of the app is in English.

*Tip: You can also click the feedback button in the app.*

#### The app does not show up in the menu bar

macOS hides menu bar apps when there is no space left in the menu bar. This is a common problem on MacBooks with a notch. Try quitting some other menu bar apps to free up space. If this does not solve it, try quitting Bartender/Ice if you have it installed.

#### Does it show calendar events?

No. That is outside the scope of the app. My [Today](/today) (free) and [Dato](/dato) (paid) apps have that.

#### Does it support highlighting certain days of the week?

No. Check out my [Dato](/dato) app for that.

The app does support dimming the weekend though.

#### Does it include widgets?

No. Check out my [Dato](/dato) app for that.

#### Does it support showing a date and time in the menu bar with a custom format?

No. Check out my [Dato](/dato) app for that.

#### Does it have a 3-month view?

No

#### Why does it not show week 53?

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar). You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### Why does it show the last days of December as week 1?

That is called [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date).

#### It shows the incorrect week number

You are probably expecting [ISO week-numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) while having your system set to [Gregorian week numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date#Relation_with_the_Gregorian_calendar), or the inverse. You can change it with [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### How can I change the week number to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) format?

Change [this system setting](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191445/standard-iso-8601-week-number-in-calendar-app/209340#209340).

#### Can you localize the app into my language?

I do not plan to localize the app.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps. I earn money on other apps. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.
