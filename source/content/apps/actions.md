feedbackNote: |
  ### If you get a “com.apple.extensionKit.errorDomain error 2” error when running your shortcut or if the actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app, restart your device. You could also try setting a different device language and then back. If you just updated the operating system, give it some time to re-index all shortcut actions. Please don't contact me about this issue. This is a problem with iOS/macOS and out of my control.

  **Some actions that are not possible: orientation lock status, flashlight status, ambient sensor info, flight mode status, [and more](/actions#impossible-actions). Generally, anything related to changing system features/settings or interacting with other apps is not possible.**

The app provides lots of powerful extra actions for the Shortcuts app on macOS, iOS, and visionOS. These actions make it significantly easier to create shortcuts.

**Restart your device if the actions do not show up in the Shortcuts app. Also try setting a different device language and then back.**

#### Impossible actions {#impossible-actions}

Some common actions requests that are not possible:

- Orientation lock status
- Flashlight status
- Ambient sensor info
- Flight mode status
- Hotspot status
- Hotspot connect/disconnect
- CarPlay connection status

Anything related to changing system features/settings or interacting with other apps is generally not possible.

For these, I recommend sending a [feature request to Apple](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com).

### Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

#### I have a feature request, bug report, or some feedback

Click the feedback button in the app or [send it here.](https://sindresorhus.com/feedback?product=Actions&referrer=Website-FAQ)

#### The actions don't show up in the Shortcuts app

This is caused by a iOS/macOS bug.

Some things you could try:

1. Restart your device.
1. Change the device language to something else and back.
1. Add [this shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/14315b9af3774a0c8cb439718a67fb2f), run it once, and see if the actions show up in the Shortcuts app after that.

#### I get a “errorDomain error 2” error when running an action

Same solution as above.

#### Why is this free without ads?

I just enjoy making apps and want this to be available for everyone. Consider leaving a nice review on the App Store.

#### How can I prevent the app from being offloaded when I have “app offloading” enabled on iOS?

iOS does not have a way to prevent individual apps from being offloaded (even though it should!) and there is no way for apps to tell iOS not to offload them. I recommend [sending feedback to Apple](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com) about this. You could try [this workaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/85k8b5/disable_offloading_for_specific_apps/).
