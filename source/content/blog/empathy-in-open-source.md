The success of any open source project relies on the collaboration and participation of individuals from all over the world. In order to foster a healthy and productive open source community, it's crucial to prioritize empathy and kindness towards one another.

Empathy allows us to understand and relate to the experiences of others. It's important to recognize that not everyone has the same level of expertise or access to resources, and that's okay. Instead of dismissing someone's perspective or ideas, try to understand where they are coming from and how you can work together to achieve a common goal.

Kindness is about treating others with respect and compassion. It's important to remember that behind every screen is a real person with their own unique experiences and challenges. By being kind to one another, we can create a welcoming and supportive environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated.

Empathy and kindness can manifest in a variety of ways. It could mean taking the time to review someone's code and providing constructive feedback instead of tearing it apart. It could mean welcoming new contributors and making an effort to help them feel included.

Remember, empathy and kindness is a choice.
